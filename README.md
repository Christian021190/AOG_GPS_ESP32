# AOG_GPS_ESP32
# DUAL GPS supported!!
Bridge between GPS receiver and AgOpenGPS: transmit GPS Signal via WiFi or USB.

Works with 1 or 2 UBlox receivers to calculate heading+roll. Corrects position by using roll and filters, depends on GPS signal quality.
With 1 receiver: filters and transmits position to AOG and NTRIP from AOG to UBlox

for ESP32

you can use WiFi connection or USB

you can change the settings via webinterface: x.x.x.79
when access to your network fails, an accesspoint is created. Webinterface: 192.168.1.1

for easier setup use webinterface, turn debugmessageUBX on and change PIN allignment until you get data from the receivers


Config via UCenter:
First set on both boards UART1 speed to 115200, UART2 speed to 460800 and activate NMEA+UBX+RTCM3 to inputs and UBX +RTCM3 to output on UART1+2. Then set Nav Rate to 100ms (10Hz).
In the messages I deactivated everything expect of (UBX) NavPVT and (NMEA) GSV on UART1 at one board and NavRelPosNED on UART1 at the other board. At both activate the RTCM messages 1077/1087/1097/1127/1230/4072.0/4072.1 on UART2.

Donâ€™t forget to save the config!

Wireing the receiver boards:
Connect Tx2 and Rx2 from one board to the other to get RTCM over (1x).
Connect RX1 and TX1 from both boards to ESP32 GPIOs (not #6-12) (IOref to 3.3V!!!)
The ESP32 is connected to both boards UART1 separately (2x2 pins, RX/TX crossed (setup zone in code)). From one board you get UBX NavPVT and from the other UBX NavRelPosNED.

# !!When using a new Version, set EEPROM_clear = true; (line 97) - flash - boot reset to EEPROM_clear = false; and flash again to reset settings!!
